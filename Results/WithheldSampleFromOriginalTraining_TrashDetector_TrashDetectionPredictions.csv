0,"Hall is well worthy to look out upon such a surrounding as this, standing as it does upon a green terrace, just as fine an old mansion as a moderate Englishman would wish to own. Beyond the lawn and garden plots, numerous secluded walks make a dive into where the shrubbery is thickest, and lead rapidly down towards the Ash which babbles to the sun through a shadowy fret- work of birch and elm and pine. The whole place, at the time of which we write, was kept in admirable order by the gardener, a quaint old Scotsman, named Willie Scott, whom Mr Alton had brought from his native north many years before ; but who, in spite of all his English surroundings, still retained his national manners and dialect, and also that rugged pride which is peculiar to those who have been born and reared in the land of cakes and heather. From his long and intimate connection with them, he stood upon very little ceremony with the family ; and by many of their visitors he was regarded as a natural curiosity. Mr Alton's friends generally bestowed more time upon him than they would spend over the rarest of his exotics ; they took a pleasure in his con- versation, and respected him as a grand improve- ment on the Scotsman one meets in the City, who has come to the south that his keen brains may have a wider and a more lucrative field, who left his nationality when he' crossed the Tweed, and who, seemingly, studies to look as ridiculous as possible by the style in which, he apes the English airs and speech. Some of the Ashfield visitors took a good- natured delight in bothering the old man about s ome of his national peculiarities, but Willie was quite able to give, as he took, with the utmost good humour ; and it was rarely that he showed the red glow of his wrath ; but at times, when a visitor might verge on the impudent, he would sting him into a better grace. The lodge at the entrance to the grounds was his home, where he slept alone ; but, for the last few years, a girl from the village was in attendance during the day to make ready his meals, and, as he would say, ' to make the place snod.",not_trash,,0.6550418,0.34495822
1,"The man who would map out the currents of the ocean would confer a signal benefit upon his race and accomplish a most labo- rious task-, butlfe who would trace and expose all the under currents of a court would undertake a more herculean enterprise still. Nor can the wisest and the best of those who rule the destinies of men escape such pernicious influences. They can but judge by what they see, while it is what they do not see which is bearing them wrong. They may consult the magnet or the pole star, they may reckon closely and well, but they can neither calculate nor perceive those under cur- rents which are bearing them upon the shoals or rocks of injustice or of danger. Nor are they in most cases to blame. Suffice it, if in regard to great and plain facts where there can be no deceit, their unassisted judgment leads them right. I myself, accustomed to courts, have seen the wisest, the very firmest of men misled to do small acts of wrong to their most deserv- ing of friends.",not_trash,,0.5987822,0.40121785
2,"He had thrown the brand of wickedness and rebellion upon earth, and it must be his destiny to see it shoot forth its fires in ten thousand terrible and devastating forms. The overwhelming misery of Nichar's spirit nothing but such a spirit can know. He groaned, and sickened through the farthest depths of his soul, and turned to escape from the fiery scourge of his own thought; but there was no hope — no peace — no escape; — eternity was before — vengeance behind ; and pain, and evil, and remorse, moulded into the very vitality of his being. But the rage of his agony gave him power. He rushed furiously upon the demonian troop, and attempted to snatch Lilith from among them. It was vain !

3,"But Henry always had the comfortable faculty of throwing off any feeling of com- punction which occasionally visited him ; and I had no doubt by this time he had com- pletely absolved himself from blame. CHAPTER V. Of the week which followed my father's death I will not write. Who is so fortunate as not to know, by bitter experience, tlie miseries of such a period : the darkened Iiouse, the stealthy footsteps, the whisperin^^ voices, the glimpses occasionally caught of strange men in shabby suits of black, the smothered tread of the same grim attendants in a house of mourning, as they pass the door of the room where you are weeping, carrying with them that weighty thing, which, senseless as it is, sends a cold shudder to the heart as it gives audible tokens of its presence, care- fully as it is taken up the stairs? I believe all these things are unknown to the rich and great : that fashion carries the D 5 living from the abode of the dead ; and though they may take sorrow within their hearts, they leave the gloom and outward evidences of its existence to servants and hired mourners. We tasted the full bitterness of death ; and when my father was laid in the grave, and light and sound once more admitted within our dwelling, ray heart seemed still more saddened by the contrast they offered to my feelings.",not_trash,,0.4315653,0.5684346

7,"This is the only part of the reverend gentleman's letter that directly affects this history. The rest contains some scandal concerning greater personages about the court; a great share of abuse of the Elector of Hanover, and a pretty description of a boxing-match at Mr. Figg's amphitheatre in Oxford Road, where John Wells, of Edmund Bury (as by the papers may be seen), master of the noble science of self-defence, did engage with Edward Sutton, of Gravesend, master of the said science, and the issue of the combat. “N. B. (adds the father, in a postscript) Monsieur Figue gives a hat to be cudgelled for before the Master mount, and the whole of this fashionable information hath been given me by monseigneur's son, Monsieur Billings, garçon-tailleur, Chevalier de Galgenstein.” Mr. Billings was, in fact, a frequent visitor at the ambassador's house; to whose presence he, by a general order, was always admitted. As for the connexion between Mrs. Catherine and her former admirer, the abbé's history of it is perfectly correct; nor can it be said that this wretched woman, whose tale now begins to wear a darker hue, was, in any thing but soul, faithless to her husband. But she hated him, longed to leave him, and loved another; the end was coming quickly, and every one of our unknowing actors and actresses were to be implicated, more or less, in the catastrophe.",not_trash,,0.69142216,0.30857784

Marionetta sat at the harp; the Honorable Mr. Listless sat by her, and turned over her music, though the exertion was almost too much for him. The Reverend Mr. Larynx relieved him occasionally in this delightful labour. Scythrop, tormented by the demon Jealousy, sat in the corner, biting his lips and fingers.

He turned to the man, who was doubtful whether to rush into the chapel for his comrades, or singly to seize his prisoner—his dagger was drawn. “Put up that foolish steel,” said York, “it cannot harm one whom God calls to freedom—listen, he speaks;—farewell!” The lightning again flashed: with blue and forked flame it ran along the blade of the weapon raised against him; with a shriek the man dashed it to the earth.",not_trash,,0.6555464,0.34445363

He felt her vibrating before she looked up at him and said, timidly, “Will you let me?” He answered only by a smile, and by leading her forward in front of the cerretano, who, seeing an excellent jest in Tessa's evident delusion, assumed a surpassing sacerdotal solemnity, and went through the mimic ceremony with a liberal expenditure of lingua furbesca or thieves' Latin. But some symptoms of a new movement in the crowd urged him to bring it to a speedy conclusion and dismiss them with hands outstretched in a benedictory attitude over their kneeling figures. Tito, disposed always to cultivate goodwill, though it might be the least select, put a piece of four grossi into his hand as he moved away, and was thanked by a look which, the conjuror felt sure, conveyed a perfect understanding of the whole affair. But Tito himself was very far from that understanding, and did not, in fact, know whether, the next moment, he should tell Tessa of the joke and laugh at her for a little goose, or whether he should let her delusion last, and see what would come of it— see what she would say and do next. “Then you will not go away from me again,” said Tessa, after they had walked a few steps, “and you will take me to where you live.”",not_trash,,0.67934096,0.32065907

Moreover, he wanted to show Mistress Grisell, as one of the few who cared for it, the manuscripts he had collected on the history of Troy town, and likewise the strange machine on which he was experimenting for multiplying copies of the translation he had in hand, with blocks for the woodcuts which Grisell could not in conscience say would be as beautiful as the ^oro-eous illumma- tions of his books.

24,"As the proofs against De Blenau were, of course, very defective, the last command of Richelieu to Lafemas, before leaving Lyons, was to spare no power of intimidation, in order to make the pri- soner criminate himself, before even granting him the form of a trial. In pursuance of these direc- tions, Lafemas ceased not for some days to tor- ment De Blenau >vith continual interrogatories, mingled with menaces and irritation, ingeniously calculated either to frighten his victim into some confession of guilt, or to throw him off his guard by rousing his anger. More than once he was carried into the chamber of the Question, and once was even bound to the rack. But though, in the secret halls of the Bastille, Lafemas would not have scrupled to proceed to any act of cruelty, yet at Lyons, amidst people upon whose silence he could not rely, he dared not put the prisoner to the question, without some appearance of legal authority. At length, therefore, the day for his trial was fixed ; but yet Lafemas prepared to make him previously undergo a species of refined torture, which none but a demon' could have devised. Denied all the privileges usually conceded to prisoners, unacquainted with the precise charges to be brought against him, refused all legal assistance, and debarred the use of pen and ink, De Blenau clearly saw that Richelieu had resolved on his destruction, and merely grant- ed him the form of a trial to gloss over his tyranny, in the eyes of the people; never- theless, he prepared to defend himself as far as possible, and at all events to establish his inno- cence ; for the honour of his good name, though it might not even tend to save him from the in- justice with which he was threatened.

Poor Elvin- ston, deeply affected by the vows he was then pledging to a stranger in a land of strangers, was more than usual ungainly and unpleasing of aspect; while it must be owned that Sergius Gallitzin gained wonderfully by having a prominent part to play ; and in his uniform, glittering with foreign and national orders, looked to perfection the imperial favourite and dignified Ambassador. I could see that Ida felt proud of him. If she already affected something of the Juno, she seemed to have found a Jove to her satisfaction.

A loud, hoarse, long-continued shout re- sounded far and wide, as the multitude vociferated success and life to Richard the Fourth. After some further discussion and explanations, mingled with directions on the part of Father Hubert, the rabble rout slowly retired ; some hurried to deposit their wives and children in a place of se- curity, that anxiety for their safety might uot interfere with their own proceedings, while others went to seize arms, wherever they could find them, that they might not join their new leader empty-handed. Long after the crowd had separated, the priest lingered on the spot in deep meditation; his restless ambition and scheming brain were still at work for the cause that had for such a length of time engaged all his energies; the point at which he aimed was neither the overthrow of Henry Tudor nor the elevation of York, but rather the rule of the fair realm of England in his own person, through the weak instrument he proposed to decorate with the ensigns of power. Sanguine as was his character, he could not but feel that the fickle and undis- ciplined multitude, from whom he had just parted, would prove no very valuable aux- iliaries ; their constancy was even less to be relied on than their experience.

The timbers, of which it was partly composed, were fastened much in the same way as those of our little boat were put together; but the part that seemed most curious to us was a sort of out-rigger, or long plank, which was attached to the body of the canoe by means of two stout cross beams. These beams kept the plank parallel with the canoe, but not in contact with it, for it floated in the water with an open space between; thus forming a sort of double canoe. This we found was intended to prevent the upsetting of the canoe, which was so narrow that it could not have maintained an upright position without the out-rigger.
