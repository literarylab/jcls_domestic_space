At such times as these Claud would inwardly rage and fume, heaping vituperative epithets upon himself and others, and declaring to himself that the girl was a heartless coquette, that he had been a fool to take her seriously, and that he would assuredly do so no longer. It was all supremely ridiculous, no doubt ; but it seems just possible that some reader of these words may remember to have been almost as absurd himself, once upon a time, and will therefore make allowances for Claud's tem- porary idiocy. Moreover, Nina was unques- tionably even more capricious and perplexing in her ways than the generality of her charm- ing sex. One day she would be melancholy, dreamy, sentimental ; the next she would affect a hardened disbelief in all the finer feelings of our nature, and would nip every approach to tenderness in the bud by laughter too hearty to be feigned.
