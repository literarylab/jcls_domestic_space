Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her own weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost good will. With a letter in her out-stretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room, saying, ‚ÄúNow, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.‚Äù Marianne heard enough.

For then his brother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun.

Why they were different, Robert explained to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education; while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school, was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man. ‚ÄúUpon my soul,‚Äù he added, ‚ÄúI believe it is nothing more; and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving about it.","other"

And his savings had been so constantly drawn upon (besides the terrible sweep of paying for Seth's substitute in the militia), that he had not enough money beforehand to furnish even a small cottage, and keep something in reserve against a rainy day. He had good hope that he should be “firmer on his legs” by-and-by; but he could not be satisfied with a vague confidence in his arm and brain; he must have definite plans, and set about them at once. The partnership with Jonathan Burge was not to be thought of at present—there were things implicitly tacked to it that he could not accept; but Adam thought that he and Seth might carry on a little business for themselves in addition to their journeyman's work, by buying a small stock of superior wood and making articles of household furniture, for which Adam had no end of contrivances. Seth might gain more by working at separate jobs under Adam's direction than by his journeyman's work, and Adam, in his over-hours, could do all the “nice” work, that required peculiar skill.","other"

That was Adam's state of mind in this second autumn of his sorrow. His work, as you know, had always been part of his religion, and from very early days he saw clearly that good carpentry was God's will —was that form of God's will that most immediately concerned him; but now there was no margin of dreams for him beyond this daylight reality, no holiday-time in the working-day world; no moment in the distance when duty would take off her iron glove and breastplate, and clasp him gently into rest. He conceived no picture of the future but one made up of hard-working days such as he lived through, with growing contentment and intensity of interest, every fresh week: love, he thought, could never be anything to him but a living memory—a limb lopped off, but not gone from consciousness.","other"

Unfortunate RafFerty was marched limping into the room as a prisoner, with his left leg even more shrunk to appearance than I had before seen it. I appealed to the surgeon's certificate attached to his attestation of his perfect capability for the service ; to the re-examination he underwent at the head-quarters the day previous to the inspection, by the surgeon then present; to his able performance on parade, in marching in slow and quick time, perfectly to the satisfaction of the inspecting general ; and to the adjutant, for his testimony of the prisoner's activity of limb dur- ing several hours' drill that very day ; expressing my own conviction that the appearance of con- traction in the leg was a mere trick. The major took occasion, as being the oldest soldier, to detain the inquest, by describing some of the tricks of old hands which he had witnessed at Gibraltar. At the mention of this place, the tinker's face assumed a ghastly hue, and he ap- peared ready to sink on the spot : he was set down by the shrewd major as a malingarer, a sham cripple, in which opinion the surgeon joined, although, after many bungling attempts, he failed to elucidate his theory of voluntary contraction and expansion of the muscles and sinews. As for the adjutant, (who would, like Sir Thomas More, have cracked a joke on the scaffold,) he contented himself with observing to the culprit, that it was the height of criminality and folly in him to enlist for a soldier ; "" for you know, my good fellow, if you received the word march, you would halt, and render yourself liable to be shot for dis- obedience of orders,"" At length, after some little deliberation, in which the culprit was spared the trouble of defence, by none being required of him, it was unanimously resolved to send him to the guard-house, preparatory to holding a court-martial on him the next morning, when he might be flog- ged, secundum artem, and discharged with the usual formality. But half an hour had not elapsed before the serjeant of the guard reported that the tinker had evinced such impatience under his moderate restraint, that it required the whole guard to overpower him, so that it became necessary to hand-cuff him and put him in the black-hole, a precaution highly approved of by the command- ing officer and adjutant ; and thus the poor tinker was left to his fate.","other"

She arose; tried to conceal the sorrow visible in her countenance yet wet with tears, and assuming as much as she could her native ease and sweetness, she advanced towards his Lordship, who still stood at the door, amazed, and asked him if he would pardon her for desiring him to sit down in a bed-chamber; if not, she would wait on him below. She then went back to the table; threw the papers into the casket that was on it; and placing a chair between that and the fire, again asked him if he would do her the honour to sit down.","domestic"

I had the good fortune to help in saving, at least from immediate de- struction, above twenty of these luckless victims; and I was with the farne set of active seamen returning a third time to the shore, when our boat was blown out of the water by the explosion of one of the ships. You remember that I was always a good swimmer ; I was not wounded, though so stunned, that I think it must have been aminuteor two before I recollected myself, and made my way by swimming to the shore, where I almost instantly received a pistol shot, and fell sense less on the beach. The man who fired at me probably believed me dead; a belief to which I undoubtedly owed my preservation; for he in all likelihood went to wreak his vengeance in some other quarter, and I found myself alone and bleeding on the shore. The flames that were raging around, the groans of the dying, the shrieks of the pri- soners, and the savage shouts of triumph, recalled recalled me to a consciousness of my situation. I tried to get up, though I knew that to escape was impossible, and that my death was inevitable; but when I would have arisen, I found myself so weak from loss of blood, and my clothes so heavy with the water, that I was quite unable to stand; I therefore crawl- ed towards a broken boat that lay a few yards farther, and, lying. down beneath it, prepared, as well as the confused state of my head would let me, for the death that awaited mc.""

However, it was a great sacrifice ; and sometimes an half envious sensation would pass the apparently prosperous Lady Elliot's mind, when she viewed the humble wife, whose lowly lot com- manded little earthly good, trusting in Him who seeth in secret, without whose aid the art of man is vain, and with whom the ignorant are all-sufficient. Education, habits of employment, and books, are never so much prized as in the confinement of a sick-chamber; Caroline's could hardly be called such, but she was almost always at home, and many hours of the day quite alone. Lucy had left her ; her parents had then own employments, and Lord Elliot, whether from restless- ness or activity of spirit, was seldom easy but when engaged in some pursuit out of doors, and was hardly a day within, unless confined by outrageously bad wea- ther or fatigue. At such times, it was not Caroline's society he sought ; he would shut himself up in his study, when his attentions to his father and mother allowed, in which sanctum sanc- f 2 torum, amidst papers and pamphlets, his door was closed even on his wife. Lord Elliot had talents, had knowledge ; he had seen and read much, but he commu- nicated little ; and it seemed often pain- ful for him to converse even with his own family. With strangers, his manners were repulsive, unless the topic was poli- tics ; then his whole nature was changed ; his sparkling eye and expressive lan- guage proclaimed the ascendency of this powerful passion, Caroline knew nothing of politics ; she could not therefore profit by such temporary fits of animation.","domestic"
