"Among other things, the talk turned on the revolt which had broken out the day before. Mr. Cameron belonged to a family which had distinguished itself by upholding liberal views during the long reign of the Tory party in England and Scotland. A thorough Liberal himself, he had long been disgusted with the state of things in Russia ; and, though far too wary (canny Scot that he was) to speak out his mind openly, he thoroughly sympathised with the conspirators, and, so far from being shocked at the outbreak, looked on its authors as heroes. Helen had been brought up in her father's views, and shared them with all the strength of her enthusiastic nature. Now that Mr. Cameron was alorte with her, and pretty sure that there were no ears in the walls, he spoke warmly about the unhappy men who had been checkmated the day before. He knew some of the leaders ; and lie spoke of them as martyrs in the cause of freedom. One expression, which he used, struck Helen very much.","domestic"

And, woman-like, she remem- bered with a kind of dismay that Ralph had many points in common with these unfortu- nate sons of genius, notably a disinchnation to follow public taste, merely for the sake of the pecuniar}- reward it would bring.
